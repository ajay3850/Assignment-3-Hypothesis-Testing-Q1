# Assignment-3-Hypothesis-Testing-Q1
 A F&amp;B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
AnswerTtest_indResult(statistic=0.7228688704678063, pvalue=0.4722394724599501)Inferences= (p value=0.472) > (Î±=0.05) Means we use Null Hypothesis i.e.No difference between diameter cutlets of two units
